# Printf
The **ft_printf** project is a challenge within the 42 School curriculum aimed at deepening students' understanding of variadic functions, formatted output, and string manipulation in C. The goal is to create a function that mimics the behavior of the standard C library's `printf` function, capable of formatting and printing various types of data.

## **Task**

The task was to implement the `ft_printf` function, which formats and prints data to the standard output according to a specified format string. The function needs to handle various conversion specifiers such as:

- Printing different data types, including characters, strings, integers, and hexadecimal values.
- Managing flags, width, precision, and length modifiers in the format string.
- Handling edge cases, such as printing `NULL` strings, negative numbers, and large integers.

**Key objectives included:**
- Designing a function that supports a wide range of format specifiers like `%d`, `%s`, `%x`, `%p`, and more.
- Ensuring correct parsing and handling of flags, width, precision, and length modifiers to match the behavior of the standard `printf`.
- Implementing a robust and efficient solution that handles various edge cases and performs well with different input scenarios.

## **Key Achievements**
- Comprehensive Format Specifier Support: Successfully implemented a wide range of format specifiers and modifiers, ensuring that `ft_printf` behaves similarly to the standard `printf`.
- Efficient Variadic Function Management: Developed a robust approach to handling variadic arguments, allowing the function to dynamically manage different types and numbers of input parameters.
- Modular and Maintainable Code: Created a modular and reusable codebase with clear separation of concerns, making the function easy to maintain and extend for future enhancements.
